    <p>A small circle indicates a ping-pong ball, moving across the screen in a linear trajectory.
If he hits the boundary of the playing field, or one of the drawn rackets, his trajectory changes according to the angle of collision.
The gameplay is that players move their rackets vertically to protect their own goal.
A player receives one point if he manages to send the ball beyond the opponent's racket line.</p>
